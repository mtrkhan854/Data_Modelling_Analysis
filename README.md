# Data Modelling and Analysis

This repository contains code (R and Weka) and report for data analysis project on plant dataset, generated by University of Nottingham's Computer Vision Lab. This was part of the G54DMA module taught at the UoN. 

Quick Overview:

In this project, using R and Weka, the following tasks were accomplished:

- Clean, reduce and transform dataset using standard procedures such as data imputing, normalizing, standardizing, dimensionality reduction using Principle Component Analysis

- Visualise and analyze the data in depth through statiscal metrics and ggplot2 

- Perform various unsupervised learning and paramter optimization

The report, along with the code and dataset have been included to recreate the exact findings
